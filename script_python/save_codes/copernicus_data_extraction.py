#%% Explaining the script
"""
This script comes from the ERA5 data API on the Copernicus website; I didnâ€™t write 
it myself. On the site used to download ERA5 data, the API provides the code based 
on which data you want to download and in what format.

ERA5 data site : 
https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview

Note: After downloading, all files were renamed.
