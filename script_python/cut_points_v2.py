#%% Explaining what the script does
"""
In this script, we work with either the southern or northern section of the 
coastline around Le Croisic and the Gu√©rande salt marshes.

The goal is to select specific points along the coastline in order to gradually 
increase the spacing between them, moving away from Le Croisic either to the north 
or to the south, depending on which coastline section is used.
